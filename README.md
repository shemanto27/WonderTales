### Server Folder (`backend/`)
The `backend` directory contains the core application logic. It is built with **Django REST Framework** and is fully containerized. 
- **Core Configuration:** Settings are managed through environment variables (`.env`).
- **Scalability:** Each feature (Users, Recipes, Posts) resides in its own Django App under `apps/` to maintain a clean codebase.
- **Production Grade:** Uses Gunicorn as the WSGI server and Nginx as the reverse proxy for high performance and security.

### Infrastructure (`infra/`)
This project utilizes automated provisioning and configuration:
- **Terraform:** Used for one-click provisioning of the entire AWS environment.
- **Ansible:** Responsible for installing Docker, configuring Nginx, and deploying the latest code automatically on newly created servers.


## 7. Environment Variables
Managed via `.env` file located in the `backend/` directory.
- Refer to `backend/.env` for the list of required variables.
- Required variables include: `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DEBUG`.

## 8. Local Development Setup
Detailed instructions are provided in the **[DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)**.
Basic requirements:
- Python 3.12+
- `uv` installed
- Docker (optional but recommended)

## 9. Database & Migrations
- **Initialization:** `python manage.py makemigrations`
- **Apply Migrations:** `python manage.py migrate`
- **Admin User:** [Refer to the CLI output or DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE for default credentials]

## 10. API Documentation
Available endpoints (once running):
- **Swagger:** `http://localhost:8000/api/swagger.json/`
- **ReDoc:** `http://localhost:8000/api/docs/`

## 11. Authentication
- **Method:** JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Format:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Endpoints:** `/api/token/` (Obtain) and `/api/token/refresh/` (Refresh)

## 12. Deployment
- **Environments:** Staging, Production (AWS ready)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions configured for automated builds and deployment.

## 13. Monitoring & Logging
- **Health Check:** `/api/health-check/` (placeholder)
- **Logging:** Configured via Django LOGGING settings.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics available at `/metrics/` (if enabled).

## 14. Security Considerations
- Secrets are never committed to version control (.env excluded).
- Passwords hashed via Argon2/PBKDF2.
- CORS headers correctly configured.

## 15. Maintenance & Handover Notes
- **New Apps:** Use `ocd` or standard Django commands inside `backend/apps/`.
- **Backups:** Database backups should be managed at the RDS/Server level.
